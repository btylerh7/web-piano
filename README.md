# Web Piano
In my job as an online music teacher, I had a lesson where students learned about the piano and the musical note names for each key on the piano. I found that my students were having trouble making the connection between the note names and the keys, so I decided to create this virtual piano for them to be able to visualize the piano and the notes while also being able to interact with it and hear how the notes sound when they click the keys.

This app was built using React with Typescript. I also used the **amazing** Tonejs library to create the sound that plays when a key is clicked.
